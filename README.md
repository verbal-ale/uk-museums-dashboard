# UK Museums Data Dashboard


_A dashboard I helped develop as part of my Data Visualisation and Analytics course at Heriot-Watt University in Jan-May 2024. For this coursework, myself and 3 other students were required to design and develop an interactive data
visualisation application for a dataset of our choice._

<!--
	Importantly you should maintain a README markdown file in your project that will contain and describe the structure of your project:
    	- What are the files?
    	- What is their purpose?
    	- How do they relate to/depend on each other?
   	 
	Someone accessing your project for maintenance or improvements should get a comprehensive understanding of your applicationâ€™s architecture from this file.

	Each script should also be appropriately commented.
