<!-- Remember to keep this README file updated as you develop your interactive data visualisation dashboard. --> 

<!-- 
    Importantly you should maintain a README markdown file in your project that will contain and describe the structure of your project: 
        - What are the files? 
        - What is their purpose? 
        - How do they relate to/depend on each other? 
        
    Someone accessing your project for maintenance or improvements should get a comprehensive understanding of your application’s architecture from this file. 

    Each script should also be appropriately commented.
